# Hash Set

My recreation of well known fast lookup data structure.
Includes common set operations.

This project is a part of (vector)[https://github.com/evgeesm/vector) hierarchy.

## Implementation details

Collision resolution performed using open addressing with linear probing.

Hashset will grow x2 when reaches maximum capacity and will consequently perform rehashing of all elements.
